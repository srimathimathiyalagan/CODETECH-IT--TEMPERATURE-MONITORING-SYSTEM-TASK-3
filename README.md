# CODETECH-IT--TEMPERATURE-MONITORING-SYSTEM-TASK-3

NAME : SRIMATHI

COMPANY : CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS

INTERN ID : CT08QQF

DOMAIN : EMBEDDED SYSTEMS

DURATION :  FEBRUARY 5th, 2025 to MARCH 5th, 2025 (4 WEEKS)

MENTOR : NEELA SANTHOSH

### **Objective**
To design a temperature and humidity monitoring system using an Arduino microcontroller, a DHT22 sensor, and an I2C LCD display. The system reads real-time temperature and humidity data, displays it on an LCD screen, and controls an LED based on temperature conditions.

### **Key Components**
Arduino Microcontroller – Processes sensor data and controls the LED based on temperature readings.
DHT22 Sensor – Measures temperature and humidity with higher accuracy.
I2C LCD Display (16x2) – Displays real-time temperature and humidity readings.
LED Indicator – Turns ON if the temperature is below or equal to 30°C and OFF otherwise.
Serial Communication – Outputs sensor readings to the Serial Monitor for debugging.


### **Technology Used**
Embedded C (Arduino IDE) – Programming language used for implementing the logic.
DHT Sensor Library – Reads temperature and humidity from the DHT22 sensor.
I2C Communication – Reduces wiring complexity while interfacing with the LCD.
Digital Output Control – Manages the LED based on temperature thresholds.
Serial Communication (UART) – Prints temperature and humidity data for monitoring and debugging.

### **SIMULATOR OUTPUT**
